/// The serverSecret is only required when you need to use this demo to build a Flutter web platform.
/// The web platform requires token authentication due to security issues. To enable you to quickly experience it,
/// this demo uses client-side code to generate tokens for authentication, which requires the use of serverSecret.
/// In a real project, you need to generate tokens on the server side and distribute them to the client,
/// so as to effectively protect the security of your app.
